like jquery it helps in easying the code
use atom . for entering it directly into the atom kernel

after following these steps 
we have to install express
node server.js to run the server

the local host helps in running a local host for our site
localhost:3000 is the syntax for it
it is like home page for google

for triggering and getting stuffs from the server 
we have to use this above the anonymous function

const { response } = require("express");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/",function(request, response){
    response.send("<h1>This is shaam</h1>")
})
app.listen(3000, function(){
    console.log("ssn");
});

first 3 lines of code is just like for calling assigning and installing node
next 2 lline of code for getting response
nxt for listening

quit the server run there and then reload in the browser

use sendFile
 for selecting the entire file
 
use __dirname
for selecting any directory let be even be hosted in a server

npm install body-parser
for parsing the body or the info to be sent

for using body-parser we will be using
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended : true}))
for posting many objects

getting  the specified stuff
req.body.num1
so on
