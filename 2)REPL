for using the command line directly like google inspect 
  type node and enter
  
use .exit or control c twice

clear to delete all the previous command

use the command
//jshint esversion:6

these are the uses of some in built node js libraries
const fs = require("fs");
fs.copyFileSync("file1.txt","file2.txt")

for running the entire stuff give node and then enter
the file will be copied from txt 1 to txt 2
