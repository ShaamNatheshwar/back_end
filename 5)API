say while we are in insta fb frnds are also come to suggestion insta asks api from fb
a set of commands , software tht programmers can use to run an external software
    endpoint 
    paths
    parametres
    authentication

every api tht interacts with a server has a endpoint

path, parametres - narrow down specific api path
parametres - go to the end of the url with a key value, each subsequent query &
authentication - to know whether u r programmer or a enterprise and charge accordingly

get the api and dpaste the api key at the end of the weather stuffs to get the current weather of your place
